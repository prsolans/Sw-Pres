                <p>Keeping a power plant running is a 24-hour job. Something's always moving&mdash;and you can't stop either. It's on you to keep systems up and the lights on. So many moving parts to the
                    equation. Corrective maintenance, lengthy shutdowns&mdash;any of these can shift the balance of power away from production and into lost revenue. The last thing you want to worry about is a
                    leaking or failed component.</p>

                <p>What if you knew there was a solution built on proven quality and industry standards for excellence? You know Swagelok tube fitting quality. Expect the same
                    quality in our other products, and in building and testing your custom solutions. </p></div>

                                <p>Tube fitting performance is defined by a robust tube grip, leak-tight gas seal, and excellent vibration resistance. The proof is in our testing

                                <p>Fluid leaks are not an option when it comes to maintaining uptime. Swagelok small bore (up to 2 in. [50 mm] O.D.) tubing reduces the number of connections and potential leak

                                <p>When it's precise pressure control you need, you need Swagelok regulators. With options like high-sensitivity and high-flow, there is a regulator to fit your power plant
                                    installation. Choose Swagelok manifolds to regulate fluid flow between pumps and actuators and other components in your fluid system.</p></div>
